## Smooth Rod:
Smooth rods, also known as linear rods or guide rods, play an important role in 3D printing by providing stability, support, and smooth linear motion to various components of the printer.
## Bearing:
The bearings serve to reduce friction and allow for smoother rotation. This cuts down on the amount of energy consumption.
## Idler:
Idler gears are used to space a reduction differently or to invert the direction of rotation. The gear in the center is the idler gear and makes no difference
## Extruder:
the part of the 3D printer that ejects material in liquid or semi-liquid form in order to deposit it in successive layers within the 3D printing volume
## Motor:
They are  essential components of a 3D printer that take care of the movements of the axes . You determine the power, temperature and operating volume of the 3D printer's motors.

## Y-AXIS ASSEMBLY:
